I'm currently a data analyst at eBay, and a data science postgrad at Johns Hopkins University.

My career began at Mercer Consulting, where I have experience in forecasting and financial analysis. There, my passion for data expanded, and I decided to pursue a career in the cutting-edge. My core competencies are in Python, R, and Java. 

I also work part-time as a property manager for a few multifamily homes in the greater Seattle area. Real-estate is another passion of mine, and I love interacting with our tenants on a daily basis.
